##  Task-2: Tic Tac Toe AI (Minimax Algorithm)

A classic **Tic Tac Toe** game where you play against an **unbeatable AI** built using the **Minimax Algorithm**.  
The project is implemented using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in **Python**.

---

## Project Overview

- Human player: **X**
- AI player: **O**
- AI plays optimally using **Minimax**, meaning it will:
   Win if possible  
   Otherwise force a draw  
   Never lose

---

## Features

- 3×3 Tic Tac Toe board
- Human vs AI gameplay
- Unbeatable AI using **Minimax**
- Valid move checking
- Game outcome detection:
  - Winner
  - Draw
  - Ongoing game status

---

## What is Minimax?

**Minimax** is a decision-making algorithm used in turn-based games.  
It explores all possible future moves and selects the best move by assuming:

- AI tries to **maximize** the score (+1)
- Human tries to **minimize** the score (-1)
- Draw = 0

This makes the AI play perfectly.

##  Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **OOP Concepts**
- **Minimax Algorithm**

---

##  How to Run

1) Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaiDeepthi-22/MyDailyWork.git
2) Navigate to the project folder
```bash
cd MyDailyWork/TASK-2_TIC_TAC_TOE_AI
3) Run the program
```bash
python main.py
```
## Notes

Ensure Python is installed and added to PATH.

This project is created for learning game AI and search algorithms.
