# Tic Tac Toe AI (Minimax Algorithm)
This project is a **Tic Tac Toe game** where:
- Human plays as **X**
- AI plays as **O**
- AI is **unbeatable** using the **Minimax Algorithm**
The entire code is written using **OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming)** in Python.
## Features
- 3×3 Tic Tac Toe board
- Human vs AI gameplay
- AI uses **Minimax** (perfect decision-making)
- Game checks:
  - Winner
  - Draw
  - Valid moves
## What is Minimax?
Minimax is an AI algorithm that checks **all possible future moves** and chooses the best one.
- AI tries to **maximize** score (+1)
- Human tries to **minimize** score (-1)
- Draw gives (0)
## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- OOPS Concepts
- Minimax Algorithm
## How to Run
